# Bunny.Swift, a Modern Swift Client for RabbitMQ

BunnySwift is a RabbitMQ client for Swift that primarily follows the API design of [Bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny) but also
borrows from the .NET, Java, Python (Pika) and Rust (amqprs) clients. It is built on
Swift NIO and modern Swift concurrency features such as async/await.

If you are looking for a RabbitMQ HTTP API for Swift 6, see [`michaelklishin/rabbitmq-http-api-client-swift`](https://github.com/michaelklishin/rabbitmq-http-api-client-swift).

## Supported iOS and macOS Versions

This library targets macOS 14+, iOS 17+, tvOS 17+, watchOS 10+, and visionOS 1+.
Swift 6.0 or later is required.


## Supported RabbitMQ Versions

Bunny.Swift targets [currently supported RabbitMQ release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).


## Project Maturity

This is a very new project by a long time member of the RabbitMQ Core Team.
Breaking public API changes are not out of the question at this stage.


## Installation

Add BunnySwift to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/michaelklishin/bunny-swift.git", from: "0.9.0")
]
```


## Quick Start

```swift
import BunnySwift

// Connect to RabbitMQ
let connection = try await Connection.open()
let channel = try await connection.openChannel()

// Declare a queue and publish a message
let queue = try await channel.queue("hello")
try await queue.publish("Hello, World!")

// Close the channel and connection. Note: this is just an example,
// real world applications should use long-lived connections as much as possible.
try await channel.close()
try await connection.close()
```


## Usage Examples

### Declaring Queue Types

```swift
// Classic queue (default)
let classic = try await channel.queue("events.classic")

// Quorum queue (replicated, durable)
let quorum = try await channel.queue(
    "events.quorum",
    type: .quorum,
    durable: true
)

// Stream (append-only log)
let stream = try await channel.queue(
    "events.stream",
    type: .stream,
    durable: true
)

// Custom or plugin-provided queue type (forward compatibility)
let custom = try await channel.queue(
    "events.custom",
    type: .custom("x-my-queue-type"),
    durable: true
)
```

### Publishing with Automatic Confirmation Tracking

```swift
// Enable publisher confirms with automatic tracking (similar to the .NET client 7.x)
// Publish methods will wait for pending confirmations to arrive before returning.
try await channel.confirmSelect(tracking: true, outstandingLimit: 128)

// Each publish now waits for confirmation (blocks until confirmed)
try await queue.publish("A message")

// Without automatic tracking (manual mode), use waitForConfirms
// to wait until all pending confirms are received.
try await channel.confirmSelect()
try await queue.publish("Message 1")
try await queue.publish("Message 2")
// Wait for all outstanding confirms
try await channel.waitForConfirms()
```

### Setting Channel Prefetch

```swift
// Limit unacknowledged messages per channel to 400
try await channel.basicQos(prefetchCount: 400)

// Or apply globally to all consumers on the connection
try await channel.basicQos(prefetchCount: 400, global: true)
```

### Binding a Queue to an Exchange

```swift
let exchange = try await channel.topic("events", durable: true)
let queue = try await channel.queue("events.important", durable: true)

// Bind with a routing key pattern
try await queue.bind(to: exchange, routingKey: "events.#")

// Or bind by exchange name
try await queue.bind(to: "events", routingKey: "events.critical.*")
```

### Consuming with Manual Acknowledgements

```swift
// Start consuming with manual acknowledgement mode (default)
let stream = try await queue.consume(acknowledgementMode: .manual)

for try await message in stream {
    // Access delivery metadata
    let delivery = message.deliveryInfo
    print("Consumer tag: \(delivery.consumerTag)")
    print("Delivery tag: \(delivery.deliveryTag)")
    print("Exchange: \(delivery.exchange)")
    print("Routing key: \(delivery.routingKey)")
    print("Redelivered: \(delivery.redelivered)")

    // Access message properties
    let props = message.properties
    if let contentType = props.contentType {
        print("Content-Type: \(contentType)")
    }
    if let messageId = props.messageId {
        print("Message ID: \(messageId)")
    }
    if let correlationId = props.correlationId {
        print("Correlation ID: \(correlationId)")
    }
    if let timestamp = props.timestamp {
        print("Timestamp: \(timestamp)")
    }
    if let headers = props.headers {
        print("Headers: \(headers)")
    }

    // Access message body
    print("Body: \(message.bodyString ?? "")")

    // Process the message, then acknowledge
    try await message.ack()

    // Or reject/requeue on failure
    // try await message.nack(requeue: true)

    // Or reject without requeuing
    // try await message.reject(requeue: false)
}
```

### Connection Recovery

Automatic connection recovery, inspired by [Ruby Bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny)
and the [Java client](https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/java-api-guide),
is enabled by default, including topology recovery.

When a connection is lost due to a network failure, heartbeat timeout, or server-initiated close, the library will automatically reconnect
and recover the topology (exchanges, queues, streams, bindings, consumers).

The recovery procedure is [standard](https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/java-api-guide#recovery) for multiple RabbitMQ client libraries.

Recovery behavior can be customised:

```swift
let config = ConnectionConfiguration(
    // Initial delay before first recovery attempt (default: 5 s)
    networkRecoveryInterval: 5.0,
    // nil for unlimited attempts (default)
    maxRecoveryAttempts: nil,
    // Exponential backoff multiplier (default: 2.0)
    recoveryBackoffMultiplier: 2.0,
    // Maximum delay between attempts (default: 60 s)
    maxRecoveryInterval: 60.0
)

let connection = try await Connection.open(config)
```

To be notified after a successful recovery:

```swift
connection.onRecovery {
    print("Connection recovered")
}
```

By default, all exchanges, queues, bindings, and consumers declared through the connection are
redeclared after reconnecting. 

To selectively skip certain entities, use a `TopologyRecoveryFilter`:

```swift
connection.setTopologyRecoveryFilter(TopologyRecoveryFilter(
    queueFilter: { queue in !queue.autoDelete },
    exchangeFilter: { exchange in exchange.durable }
))
```

To disable automatic recovery:

```swift
let config = ConnectionConfiguration(automaticRecovery: false)
```

### Unbinding a Queue from an Exchange

```swift
// Unbind using the exchange object
try await queue.unbind(from: exchange, routingKey: "events.#")

// Or by exchange name
try await queue.unbind(from: "events", routingKey: "events.critical.*")
```

### Exchange-to-Exchange Bindings

```swift
// Declare a source and destination exchange
let source = try await channel.topic("events.all", durable: true)
let destination = try await channel.fanout("events.important", durable: true)

// Bind destination exchange to the source (messages flow from source to destination)
try await destination.bind(to: source, routingKey: "events.critical.#")

// Unbind when no longer needed
try await destination.unbind(from: source, routingKey: "events.critical.#")
```

### Deleting a Queue

```swift
// Delete a queue, returns the number of messages that were in it
let deletedMessageCount = try await queue.delete()

// Only delete if no consumers are active
let count = try await queue.delete(ifUnused: true)

// Only delete if the queue is empty
let count = try await queue.delete(ifEmpty: true)

// Or use the channel directly
let count = try await channel.queueDelete("my.queue", ifUnused: true, ifEmpty: true)
```

### Deleting an Exchange

```swift
// Delete an exchange
try await exchange.delete()

// Only delete if no queues are bound to it
try await exchange.delete(ifUnused: true)

// Or use the channel directly
try await channel.exchangeDelete("my.exchange", ifUnused: true)
```

### TLS Connections

BunnySwift supports TLS connections. The following example
uses [tls-gen](https://github.com/rabbitmq/tls-gen)-generated certificates in the PEM format:

```swift
// Mutual TLS with client certificate authentication
let tls = try TLSConfiguration.fromPEMFiles(
    certificatePath: "/path/to/tls-gen/basic/result/client_certificate.pem",
    keyPath: "/path/to/tls-gen/basic/result/client_key.pem",
    caCertificatePath: "/path/to/tls-gen/basic/result/ca_certificate.pem"
)

let config = ConnectionConfiguration(
    host: "rabbit.example.com",
    // Default TLS port
    port: 5671,
    tls: tls
)

let connection = try await Connection.open(config)
```

In the case of one-way [peer verification](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/ssl#peer-verification) (client verifies RabbitMQ certificate chain but does not
have its own certificate/key pair):

```swift
// TLS with server certificate verification only
let tls = try TLSConfiguration.withCACertificate(
    path: "/path/to/tls-gen/basic/result/ca_certificate.pem"
)

let config = ConnectionConfiguration(
    host: "rabbit.example.com",
    port: 5671,
    tls: tls
)

let connection = try await Connection.open(config)
```

Using an AMQPS URI:

```swift
// URI-based configuration automatically enables TLS
var config = try ConnectionConfiguration.from(uri: "amqps://rabbitmq.eng.example.com")

// Add custom TLS settings for certificate verification
config.tls = try TLSConfiguration.withCACertificate(
    path: "/path/to/ca_certificate.pem"
)

let connection = try await Connection.open(config)
```

The following example enables mutual peer verification and combines
it with a URI:

```swift
var config = try ConnectionConfiguration.from(uri: "amqps://rabbit.example.com")
config.tls = try TLSConfiguration.fromPEMFiles(
    certificatePath: "/path/to/client_certificate.pem",
    keyPath: "/path/to/client_key.pem",
    caCertificatePath: "/path/to/ca_certificate.pem"
)

let connection = try await Connection.open(config)
```

Advanced TLS configuration:

```swift
import NIOSSL

// Fine-grained TLS configuration
var tls = TLSConfiguration(
    certificateChain: [],
    privateKey: nil,
    // Use system trust store
    trustRoots: .default,
    certificateVerification: .fullVerification,
    // Minimum TLS 1.2
    minimumTLSVersion: .tlsv12,
    // Maximum TLS 1.3
    maximumTLSVersion: .tlsv13
)

// Load certificates programmatically
let caCerts = try NIOSSLCertificate.fromPEMFile("/path/to/ca.pem")
tls.trustRoots = .certificates(caCerts)

let config = ConnectionConfiguration(
    host: "rabbit.example.com",
    port: 5671,
    tls: tls
)

let connection = try await Connection.open(config)
```

For development and testing only (not recommended for production):

```swift
// Skip peer verification: THIS IS A POOR SECURITY PRACTICE, use only for development and testing
let config = ConnectionConfiguration(
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5671,
    tls: TLSConfiguration.insecure()
)

let connection = try await Connection.open(config)
```
